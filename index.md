# ED-MMA
ED-MMA is short for Elite Dangerous Massacre Mission Assistant.
It's short vision is to help out Elite Dangerous players in massacre mission stacking and sharing.
In the future we are open to extend our tools range for general stackable missions.

# Features

- Share your current progress with pressing just one button in a formatted text for discord.
- A station overview mode automatically displayed when you land to a station from which you completed mission, so you can easily distinguish which mission to share with your wing
