# ED-MMA
ED-MMA is short for Elite Dangerous Massacre Mission Assistant.
It's short vision is to help out Elite Dangerous players in massacre mission stacking and sharing.
In the future we are open for extending our tools range for general stackable missions.

# Features
- Fully automatic massacre system mapping.
- Fully automatic progress tracking.
- Share your current progress with pressing just one button in a formatted text for discord.
- A station overview mode automatically displayed when you land to a station from which you completed mission, so you can easily distinguish which mission to share with your wing.
- When you leave a station the interface will switch to a completed mission overview mode where you can chose which station you should go next.
- When you jump to the target system the interface will switch to a progress tracker mode where it will show you the stack height from each faction and the missions' kill requirements.

# To be implemented

- Automatic tracking of Horizon and Odyssey sessions.
- Color and Ui placemant integration with the famous [EDHM](https://github.com/BlueMystical/EDHM_UI) made by Blue Mystic (o7 commander)
